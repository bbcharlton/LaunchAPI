> ### Launch Library API Application

This is by far one of my favorite applications I've created. It uses the [Launch Library API](https://launchlibrary.net/1.2/docs/api.html) to pull in data for all upcoming space rocket launches. It utilizes a Mongo database for users to register and login to save specific launch dates, along with it's information.

___

> ### Getting Started

##### 1. Clone Repo

Clone down the repo to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/bbcharlton/LaunchAPI.git

##### 2. Create Mongo Database

Create a local Mongo database to use for this application.

##### 3. Add Mongo Database

In the ```app.js``` file on line 14, change the value to your local Mongo database.

##### 4. NPM Install

Install all of the application's node modules with ```npm install```

##### 5. Start Application

Start the application by running ```node start``` from the root directory of the project.
